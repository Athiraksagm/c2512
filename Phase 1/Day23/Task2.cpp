single inheritance using static binding:
=============================================================
Create two static objects for Both Base and Derived class
and call all behaviours
and 
one two dynamic objects for Base and Derived class 
and call all behaviours

Define constructors and destructors for all the classes 

Problem 15: `Sports Management`
- Create a base class `Player` with fields `name` and `age`, and a behavior `train()`.
- Derive a class `CricketPlayer` with fields `battingAverage` and a behavior `playMatch()`.
