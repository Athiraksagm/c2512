  Key : Unique Identifier

1. Super Key: 
    a set of one or more columns (attributes) that, 
    taken collectively, 
    allow unique identification of a row in a table.

2. Candidate Key:
    a column, or a set of columns, 
    that can uniquely identify any row 
    in a table.
    Candidate keys are minimal super keys ,
    they contain no extra attributes 
    beyond what is necessary 
    to ensure uniqueness.

3. Alternate Key:
    An alternate key is any candidate key 
    that is not selected as the primary key.

4. Composite Key:
    can be Candidate Key, Super Key, Alternate Key, 
    Primary Key, Unique Key, Foreign Key. 
    A composite key is a primary key 
    that consists of two or more columns 
    to uniquely identify each row.

5. Primary Key     -- Constraint 
    A primary key is a unique identifier 
    for each record in a table.
    -The primary key cannot contain `NULL` values.

6. Unique Key [Other than the Primary Key, Nullable]   -- Constraint 
    A unique key ensures that all values 
    in a column or set of columns 
    are distinct across row.

Secondary Key:  -- Index 
    A secondary key is 
    an attribute or combination of attributes 
    used for data retrieval purposes, 
    not necessarily unique for each record.
