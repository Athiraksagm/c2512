Write a program that continuously prompts the user to enter a number. 
The program should add the entered number to the previous valid number if it is divisible by 3 or 5 and display the sum. 
If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, display a message indicating this. The program should terminate when the user types any particular character. 
Additionally, handle invalid input by prompting the user to enter a valid number.
