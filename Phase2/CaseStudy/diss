make some changes in the above code, that is, 1. I dont want the Number function and anything related to it. 2. The inputs are taken using read by number, since we are removing it and anything related to it, i want the inputs to be taken by Department Name using readbyname() function. 3. in "create" function , after creating the department i need a unique id, which can be said as a department id. 3.in edit, view, delete function during edit, ask "enter the department name" if there exist a department name, then allow to edit, else print an "error message".
