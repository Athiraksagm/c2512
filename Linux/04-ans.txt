Solution:

1. Basic File and Directory Management :

   Create a directory for storing C++ project :
   mkdir vi_cpp_project
   it will create a new directory called "vi_cpp_project" .

2. Change to the "vi_cpp_project" directory

   cd vi_cpp_project
   it will move you into the "vi_cpp_project" directory.

3. Create a new C++ file using "vim editor".

   touch welcome.cpp  - it will create a new file named "welcome.cpp" in the current directory.
   vim welcome.cpp    - to edit this file using nano editor.

4. Write a basic C++ program in vim.

    write a simple C++ program that prints "Welcome to Linux programming!" in vim editor.

     #include <iostream>
     #include <cstdlib>
     using std::cout;
     using std::endl;

     int main() {

     cout << "Welcome to Linux programming! " << endl;

	   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
     }


5. Save and exit the vim editor.

    After writing the code, save the file and exit vim by using command
    :wq

6. Edit the program.

   Open welcome.cpp again in vim , and modify the program to ask for the user's name and  greet them by name using insert mode and command mode.


   #include <iostream>
   #include <cstdlib>
   using std::cout;
   using std::cin;
   using std::endl;

     int main() {

     char name[255];

	   cout << "Enter name:";
	   cin >> name;
     cout << "Hello " << name << "Welcome to Linux programming ! " << endl;

	   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
     }

7. Compile the C++ program.

    Compile the program using the g++ compiler into an executable called "welcome".
    g++ welcome.cpp

8. Run the compiled program.

    Run the executable to check if the program works as expected (asks for name and greets).
    ./a.out

9. View the contents of the C++ file.

    Use the `cat` command to display the contents of welcome.cpp.
    cat welcome.cpp

10. Use vim to make further edits.
    
    Open `welcome.cpp` in `vi` and add an additional line to print "Goodbye!" at the end of the program.

    vim welcome.cpp

   #include <iostream>
   #include <cstdlib>
   using std::cout;
   using std::cin;
   using std::endl;

     int main() {

     char name[255];

	   cout << "Enter name:";
	   cin >> name;
     cout << "Hello " << name << "Welcome to Linux programming ! " << endl;
     cout << "Goodbye! " << endl;

	   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
     }

11. Compile and run the updated program.

    After editing, recompile and run the program to ensure it displays the welcome message followed by the goodbye message.
    g++ welcome.cpp
    ./a.out

12. Delete the C++ file.

    Once finished, remove the `welcome.cpp` file
    rm welcome.cpp

13. Remove the project directory.

   Check if the directory is empty and remove it.
   ls - to check empty or not.
   rmdir vi_cpp_project - to remove directory.
