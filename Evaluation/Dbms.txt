I have an UNF table
tickets
booking_id, booking_number, airline_id, airline_name,
customer_id, customer_name, customer_city,
flight_number, flight_date, departure_time, arrival_time,
departure_city, arrival_city, ticket_price, seat_class,
seat1_number, seat1_price,
seat2_number, seat2_price,
seat3_number, seat3_price,
meal1_item_id, meal1_item_name, meal1_price, meal1_qty, meal1_amount,
meal2_item_id, meal2_item_name, meal2_price, meal2_qty, meal2_amount,
meal3_item_id, meal3_item_name, meal3_price, meal3_qty, meal3_amount

I formed the below NF tables:
customer: customer_id, customer_name, customer_city
airline: airline_id, airline_name
seat: seat_id, seat_number, seat_price
meal: meal_id, meal_name, price

booking: booking_id, booking_number, flight_number, flight_date,  
    departure_time, arrival_time, departure_city, arrival_city,  
    ticket_price, seat_class, customer_id, airline_id  
booking_meal: meal_id, meal_name, price, quantity, amount, booking_id  
booking_seat: seat_id, seat_number, price, booking_id  

My data is going to be:
I am Aravind, and I have booked tickets for my family from Chennai to Delhi on flight AI102 operated by Air India.
flight_date: 2024-11-20, departure_time: 10:00 AM, arrival_time: 1:00 PM
seat_class: economy
seat_numbers: [12A, 12B, 12C], each seat price is Rs.5000
meals ordered: [Veg Meal @ Rs.300 x 2, Chicken Meal @ Rs.500 x 1, Coffee @ Rs.100 x 3]
And
I have booked tickets for my parents from Bangalore to Mumbai on flight SG345 operated by SpiceJet.
flight_date: 2024-11-22, departure_time: 5:00 PM, arrival_time: 7:00 PM
seat_class: business
seat_numbers: [1A, 1B], each seat price is Rs.8000
meals ordered: [Veg Meal @ Rs.300 x 1, Chicken Meal @ Rs.500 x 2]

Now, I need the table scripts in Oracle with primary keys, not null, and foreign keys.
I also need insert statements for the tables.
And I need the data in tabular form for all NF tables.

Another prompt question:
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
I have given my adhaar id for ticket booking.
We taken a flight on 20-NOV-2024 10:00AM. 
Also we taken a flight on 21-NOV-2024 13:00 PM.
Please add flight date time column and adhaar id also.
And give me tables 'alter' script and update script.


````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
prompt Solution 
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

1. `ALTER TABLE Script` for `booking` Table

```sql
ALTER TABLE booking
ADD (flight_date_time DATE);
```

`ALTER TABLE Script` for `customer` Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE customer
ADD (adhaar_id VARCHAR2(16) NOT NULL UNIQUE);
```

2. `Customer Table Data Update` (Adding Aadhaar ID as a Unique Identifier)

#Updating `adhaar_id` in the Customer Table

```sql
-- Update Aadhaar ID for Aravind in Customer Table
UPDATE customer
SET adhaar_id = '1234-5678-9012'
WHERE customer_id = 1;
```
-- Update flight date and time for the booking flight on 20-NOV-2024.
```
UPDATE booking
SET flight_date_time = TO_DATE('20-NOV-2024 10:00', 'DD-MON-YYYY HH24:MI')
WHERE booking_id = 1;

-- Update flight date and time for the booking flight on 21-NOV-2024.
UPDATE booking
SET flight_date_time = TO_DATE('21-NOV-2024 13:00', 'DD-MON-YYYY HH24:MI')
WHERE booking_id = 2;
```

Prompt 3

I need to update my flight seat booking database to track Aadhaar ID for customers and flight date/time for bookings. Additionally, I would like to calculate the total cost of a booking, including both seat prices and meal costs.

prompt solution:

INSERT INTO booking_meal (meal_id, meal_name, price, quantity, amount, booking_id, meal_preference) 
VALUES (1, 'Veg Meal', 300, 2, 600, 1, 'Vegetarian');

INSERT INTO booking_meal (meal_id, meal_name, price, quantity, amount, booking_id, meal_preference) 
VALUES (2, 'Chicken Meal', 500, 2, 1000, 2, 'Non-Vegetarian');


-- Update total meal cost for booking_id = 1
UPDATE booking
SET total_meal_cost = (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM booking_meal WHERE booking_id = 1)
WHERE booking_id = 1;

-- Update total meal cost for booking_id = 2
UPDATE booking
SET total_meal_cost = (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM booking_meal WHERE booking_id = 2)
WHERE booking_id = 2;


Updated `Booking` Table Structure in Tabular Format

booking_id booking_number flight_number  flight_date  departure_time  arrival_time  departure_city  arrival_city	ticket_price  seat_class  customer_id airline_id flight_date_time total_meal_cost 
1	          B001	           AI102	       2024-11-20	     10:00 AM	      1:00 PM	    Chennai	         Delhi	        15000      	Economy 	  1	     1  20-NOV-2024 10:00    1400
